Hello user, this is the Author of the Program (Social Footprint) ,this is my first project in python and i usually try to develope new tools for Terminal and Linux operating systems so that I can provide efficiency in Penetration testing, Ethical Hacking, my goal is to make more programs specially for Linux and Termux. 
Do not use this tool for illegal activities, i will not take any responsibilty if you use this tool to hack into individual's privacy,
• To use this tool you need to copy the path of the Chrome browser
• To bypass the login, username:socialfootprint 
and password:devpythonraz

Steps to run the Social-Footprint

1. you need to install python/python2/python3 respectively if you are using Temux,Linux,or MacOS 

2. run as (python2 Social-Footprint.py)

3. you will get an option pop up saying whether you want to read rules first or start the program

4. choose 1, if you want to read rules, because it is important to know the username and the password to bypass the logion.

5. choose 2, if you want to use Social-Footprint
and hence you need to have username and password to bypass, read rules to get the login credentials

6. start using :)

V.1 includes only instagram
